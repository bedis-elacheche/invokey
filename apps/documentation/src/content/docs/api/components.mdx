The invokey API provides a set of components for managing keyboard shortcuts in your application. These components are designed to work seamlessly with the function-based API, offering a declarative way to handle keyboard interactions. The components are built with TypeScript support and follow Svelte's component patterns for optimal integration with your application.

## Components

### Combination

```svelte
<Combination
  combinations={['ctrl+k', 'cmd+k']}
  hideAfter={2000}
>
  <div>Search panel</div>
</Combination>
```

A component that renders content based on keyboard combination detection.

#### Props

```typescript
interface CombinationProps extends CombinationOptions {
  /** Array of keyboard combinations to detect */
  combinations: Parameters<typeof useCombination>[0];
  /** Content to render when combination is detected */
  children?: Snippet;
  /** Function to render content with active combination info */
  activeCombination?: Snippet<[activeCombination: string | null]>;
  /** Time in ms after which to hide content (0 = never hide) */
  hideAfter?: number;
}
```

### Sequence

```svelte
<Sequence
  sequences="i>n>v>o>k>e>y"
  hideAfter={2000}
>
  <div>Got invoked!</div>
</Sequence>
```

A component that renders content based on keyboard sequence detection.

#### Props

```typescript
interface SequenceProps extends SequenceOptions {
  /** Array of keyboard sequences to detect */
  sequences: Parameters<typeof useSequence>[0];
  /** Content to render when sequence is detected */
  children?: Snippet;
  /** Function to render content with active sequence info */
  activeSequence?: Snippet<[activeSequence: string | null]>;
  /** Time in ms after which to hide content (0 = never hide) */
  hideAfter?: number;
}
```

### ScopeProvider

```svelte
<ScopeProvider activeScopes={['scopeA', 'scopeB']}>
  <!-- Your app content -->
</ScopeProvider>
```

A component that provides keyboard shortcut scoping functionality.

#### Props

```typescript
interface ScopeProviderProps {
  /** Content to render within the scope context */
  children: Snippet;
  /** Array of active scope names. Defaults to ['*'] for global scope */
  activeScopes?: string[];
}
```

If you set the activeScopes prop, the wildcard scope will not be active by default. You would have to set `['scopeA', '*']`.
